        <p>Welcome to our coding challenge!</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
            The following challenge requires you to successfully submit a login form via an API call. Your code should be written on a new Git branch named "feature/solution". Your form should also include form validation with proper error messages. You do not need to implement any server-side logic apart from a route to catch the response and log the submitted data.        </p>
        <p>
            Osedea has developed a library to help with form validation, we encourage you to use it for your implementation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/Osedea/angular-osd-form">https://github.com/Osedea/angular-osd-form</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We've started an angular module for you in <a href="/javascripts/app.js">/javascript/app.js</a>. You can use this for binding the form data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to refactor this project however you feel is necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>Submitting</h3>
        <p>
            To submit your solution, simply zip the project and email it back to us. Please include a brief summary of your approach to the problem in your email. Good luck!
        </p>
